Dijkstra's Algorithm
- doesn't work for negative weight cycle

Algo:
- Use priority queue to get the node with the smallest distance
- Relax all the edges coming out of the node
- If the distance to the node is smaller than the distance in the priority queue, update the distance and parent
- Repeat until all nodes are visited
