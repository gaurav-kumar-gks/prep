Adjacency Matrix

e.g. 

    A B C
A   0 1 1
B   1 0 0
C   1 0 0

The adjacency matrix for an undirected graph is symmetric
while the one for a directed graph is not necessarily symmetric.

Cons:
    - Space complexity: O(V^2)
    - Adding a new vertex requires creating a new row and a new column
    - Adding a new edge requires updating two entries
    - Determining whether there is an edge between two vertices requires looking up two entries

Types of Graphs

- Directed graph: A graph in which all the edges are directed.
- Undirected graph: A graph in which all the edges are undirected.

- Weighted graph: A graph in which all the edges have weights.
- Unweighted graph: A graph in which all the edges have no weights.

- Cyclic graph: A graph that has at least one cycle.
- Acyclic graph: A graph that has no cycles.

- Connected graph: A graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices
- Disconnected graph: A graph in which there is no path between at least one pair of vertices

- Complete graph: A graph in which there is an edge between every pair of vertices
- Incomplete graph: A graph in which there is no edge between at least one pair of vertices

- Bipartite graph: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects two vertices from different sets.
- Non-bipartite graph: A graph that is not bipartite.

- Sparse graph: A graph in which the number of edges is much less than the number of vertices
- Dense graph: A graph in which the number of edges is close to the number of vertices squared

- Tree: A connected, undirected, acyclic graph
- Forest: A collection of trees
"""


"""
Types of Edges

- Tree edge: An edge in a DFS tree
- Back edge: An edge that connects a vertex to an ancestor in a DFS tree
- Forward edge: An edge that connects a vertex to a descendant in a DFS tree
- Cross edge: An edge that connects a vertex to a node that is neither an ancestor nor a descendant in a DFS tree

consider the following graph:


    A -> B -> C
    |    |    |
    v    v    v
    D -> E -> F
    |    |    |
    v    v    v
    G -> H -> I
    
The edges in the graph are as follows:

- Tree edges: A -> B, B -> C, B -> E, D -> E, E -> F, D -> G, G -> H, H -> I
- Back edges: E -> B, G -> D, H -> G, I -> H
- Forward edges: B -> D, C -> F, E -> H, F -> I
- Cross edges: A -> C, A -> F, A -> I, D -> F, D -> I, G -> I
