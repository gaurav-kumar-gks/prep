TREE TERMINOLOGY:
    - Root: Topmost node of the tree
    - Parent: Node that has children
    - Child: Node connected to a parent
    - Leaf: Node with no children
    - Internal Node: Node with at least one child
    - Sibling: Nodes with the same parent
    - Ancestor: All nodes on path from root to current node
    - Descendant: All nodes in subtree rooted at current node
    - Height: Length of longest path from root to leaf
    - Depth: Length of path from root to specific node
    - Degree: Number of children a node has


    BALANCED TREE
        - Height difference between left and right subtrees is limited
        - Examples: AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, B-Tree
        - Advantages: Guaranteed O(log n) operations
        - Applications: Database indexing, File systems
        
    UNBALANCED TREE
        - No height restrictions
        - Can degenerate to linked list (height = n)
        - Disadvantages: O(n) worst-case operations

    COMPLETE TREE
        - All levels are filled except possibly the last level
        - Last level has all nodes as far left as possible
        - Used in: Heap, Priority Queue

    PERFECT TREE
        - All internal nodes have exactly 2 children
        - All leaves are at the same level
        - Used in: BST, AVL Tree

    BINARY TREE
        - Each node has at most 2 children (left and right)
        - Used in: BST, AVL, Red-Black trees, Heaps
        
    TERNARY TREE
        - Each node has at most 3 children
        - Used in: Some search algorithms, Game trees
        
    N-ARY TREE (GENERAL TREE)
        - Each node can have any number of children
        - Used in: File systems, Organization charts, XML/HTML DOM
