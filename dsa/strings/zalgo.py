Z-ALGORITHM - COMPREHENSIVE THEORY & IMPLEMENTATION

The Z-Algorithm is a linear time pattern matching algorithm that finds all occurrences
of a pattern in a text in O(n + m) time, where n is the length of the text and m is
the length of the pattern. It also has applications in string processing and pattern matching.

THEORY & CONCEPTS
================================================================================

1. Z-ARRAY DEFINITION:
   - Z[i] = length of longest substring starting at i that matches prefix of string
   - Z[0] is typically undefined or set to length of string
   - Z[i] = max k such that s[0...k-1] = s[i...i+k-1]

2. Z-ALGORITHM PROPERTIES:
   - Linear time complexity: O(n)
   - Space complexity: O(n)
   - Works for any string (not just patterns)
   - Can be used for pattern matching, palindrome detection, etc.

3. APPLICATIONS:
   - Pattern matching in text
   - Finding longest palindromic prefix
   - Finding string period
   - Counting distinct substrings
   - String compression
   - Bioinformatics (DNA sequence analysis)

4. ALGORITHM INTUITION:
   - Maintain a window [L, R] where we have already computed Z values
   - Use previously computed Z values to avoid redundant comparisons
   - Expand window when necessary

5. TIME COMPLEXITIES:
   - Z-array construction: O(n)
   - Pattern matching: O(n + m)
   - Palindrome detection: O(n)
   - Period finding: O(n)
